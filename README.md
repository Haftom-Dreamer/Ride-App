Ride - A Dispatcher-Based Hailing App
üìù What is this Project?
This project is a simple and modern ride-hailing app, designed from the ground up for towns like Adigrat, Ethiopia. It's built around a dispatcher model, which is perfect for a local community. Passengers use a clean, mobile-friendly website to request a ride, and a central dispatcher manages everything from a live dashboard, assigning the best driver for the job.

The whole system is built using free, open-source tools, so there are no running costs.

üéØ The Blueprint for a Mobile App
Think of this project as a complete, working blueprint. We've built this web application first to design, test, and perfect all the core logic‚Äîfrom calculating fares with real-time distance to tracking the status of a ride.

The ultimate goal is to take this proven system and use it as the foundation to build a fast, reliable, and professional cross-platform mobile app using Flutter. All the backend work (the server 'brain') will be 100% reused for the final mobile app.

‚ú® How It Works
For Passengers...
Request a ride from an interactive, real-time map of the town.

Get instant suggestions for well-known local landmarks as you type.

Choose your vehicle type (like a Bajaj).

See the real, calculated price before you book.

Track your request status, from "Finding a driver..." to seeing your assigned driver's details.

A "Call Driver" button for easy communication.

For the Dispatcher...
See all incoming ride requests on a live dashboard that refreshes automatically.

Manage your full list of drivers: add new drivers, see their details, and set their status (Available, Offline, etc.).

Assign any pending ride to an available driver with a simple click.

Mark rides as "Completed" or "Canceled" to keep the system up-to-date.

üõ†Ô∏è The Technology
This app is built with a simple, powerful, and free open-source stack, primarily:

Python (Flask) for the backend server.

JavaScript for the interactive frontend experience.

OpenStreetMap and other free tools for maps, search, and directions.

SQLite for a simple, file-based database.
