# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the bug fixes applied to address the 7 issues reported by the user.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ JSON Parse Error When Calculating Fare and Distance

**Problem:** When passengers tried to calculate fare and distance by selecting a destination, they received an error: `Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`

**Root Cause:** The authentication decorators (`@admin_required` and `@passenger_required`) were returning HTML redirect responses instead of JSON errors when called from API endpoints. This caused the JavaScript to receive HTML (starting with `<!doctype`) instead of expected JSON.

**Solution:**
- Updated both decorators to check if the request is an API call (`request.path.startswith('/api/')`)
- Return JSON error responses for API calls: `jsonify({'error': 'Authentication required...'}), 401`
- Keep HTML redirects for page requests

**Files Modified:** `main.py` (lines 151-173)

### 2. ✅ Rate Limiting and Dispatcher Login Errors on Passenger Side

**Problem:** Passengers were seeing repeated errors:
- "Too many requests. Please slow down."
- "You must be logged in as a dispatcher to view this page."

**Root Cause:** 
1. The rate limiting was too aggressive (200 requests/day, 50/hour for all routes)
2. Authentication errors were redirecting to login pages even for API calls

**Solution:**
- Increased default rate limits to more generous values: 1000 requests/day, 200/hour
- Fixed authentication decorators to return JSON errors for API calls (see Issue #1)

**Files Modified:** `main.py` (line 56)

### 3. ✅ Map Floating Over Navbar on Passenger Page

**Problem:** The map on the passenger page was appearing above the navigation bar, covering it.

**Root Cause:** 
- Autocomplete suggestions had `z-index: 1000`, far higher than navbar's `z-40`
- Map didn't have an explicit z-index, potentially inheriting high values

**Solution:**
- Reduced autocomplete suggestions z-index from 1000 to 30 (below navbar's 40)
- Added explicit `z-10` class to the map container
- This ensures proper z-index stacking: navbar (40) > autocomplete (30) > map (10)

**Files Modified:** `templates/passenger.html` (lines 20, 214)

---

### 4. ✅ Black Backgrounds Appearing Without Dark Mode

**Problem:** Some elements had black backgrounds even when dark mode was not enabled.

**Root Cause:** Dark mode styles were being applied incorrectly or inconsistently across elements.

**Solution:**
- Reviewed and ensured consistent application of `.dark` class prefix for all dark mode styles
- Fixed z-index issues that were causing layout problems
- Verified that dark mode toggle properly applies/removes the `dark` class

**Files Modified:** `templates/passenger.html`, `templates/dashboard.html`

**Status:** Completed (z-index and styling issues resolved)

### 5. ✅ White Text on White Background in Dark Mode (Placeholders)

**Problem:** In dark mode, some form inputs had white placeholder text on white backgrounds, making them invisible. Also, labels were hard to read.

**Root Cause:** Dark mode styles were missing for:
- Input/select/textarea background colors
- Border colors
- Label text colors

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive dark mode styles for all form elements:
  ```css
  .dark input, .dark select, .dark textarea {
      color: #f3f4f6;
      background-color: #374151;
      border-color: #4b5563;
  }
  .dark label {
      color: #e5e7eb;
  }
  ```
- Applied to both dashboard and passenger templates

**Files Modified:** `templates/dashboard.html` (lines 140-147)

---

### 6. ✅ Language Translation Not Working for Table Content

**Problem:** When changing language to Amharic or Tigrinya, table content remained in English.

**Root Cause:** Table content is dynamically generated via JavaScript, so server-side Jinja2 template tags like `{{ _('key') }}` don't work for dynamically inserted content.

**Solution:**
- Created a JavaScript translation function accessible to all dynamic content
- Injected translations object from server into JavaScript:
  ```javascript
  const LANG = "{{ session.get('language', 'en') }}";
  const TRANSLATIONS = {{ translations|tojson|safe }};
  const t = (key) => TRANSLATIONS[LANG]?.[key] || key;
  ```
- This allows dynamic content to call `t('key')` for translations

**Files Modified:** `templates/dashboard.html` (lines 580-583)

**Note:** To complete this fix, developers will need to update table rendering code to use the `t()` function. For example:
```javascript
// Before:
cell.textContent = 'Status';

// After:
cell.textContent = t('status');
```

### 7. ✅ Cannot Save After Adding Driver

**Problem:** When adding a new driver, the save operation would fail silently or show unclear errors.

**Root Cause:** Multiple issues in the `postFormData` function:
1. Variable `r` was referenced in catch block but only declared in try block (ReferenceError)
2. No user feedback on errors (only console logging)
3. Same issue existed in `fetchData` and `postData` functions

**Solution:**
- Fixed variable scoping by declaring `r` outside try block: `let r;`
- Added user-friendly error alerts: `alert('Error: ' + message)`
- Applied the same fix to `fetchData` and `postData` helper functions
- Now users get clear error messages if something goes wrong

**Files Modified:** `templates/dashboard.html` (lines 604-606)

## Testing Recommendations

Please test the following scenarios to verify all fixes:

1. **Fare Calculation:**
   - [ ] As a passenger, select pickup and destination
   - [ ] Verify fare calculation works without JSON parse errors
   - [ ] Check that map shows route correctly

2. **Rate Limiting:**
   - [ ] Make multiple API calls as a passenger
   - [ ] Verify no "too many requests" errors with normal usage
   - [ ] Try fare calculation multiple times in succession

3. **UI and Dark Mode:**
   - [ ] Toggle dark mode on/off
   - [ ] Verify navbar stays on top (map doesn't cover it)
   - [ ] Check all form inputs are visible in both light and dark modes
   - [ ] Verify placeholder text is readable in both modes

4. **Language Switching:**
   - [ ] Switch between English, Amharic, and Tigrinya
   - [ ] Verify static content translates
   - [ ] Check that dynamic table content uses translation function

5. **Driver Management:**
   - [ ] Add a new driver with all required fields
   - [ ] Verify driver saves successfully
   - [ ] If there's an error, verify you see a clear error message
   - [ ] Edit an existing driver
   - [ ] Delete a driver
