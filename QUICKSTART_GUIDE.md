# Quick Start Guide - Complete Passenger App

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ with Flask installed
- Flutter 3.x installed
- Android device or emulator
- ADB tools installed

## Step 1: Backend Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project root
cd C:\Users\H.Dreamer\Documents\Adobe\RIDE

# 2. Install dependencies (if needed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run database migration (IMPORTANT - Only do this once)
python migrate_ride_fields_simple.py

# 4. Start the Flask server
python run.py
# or double-click START_SERVER.bat

# Server will start on http://localhost:5000
```

**Expected output:**
```
ðŸ”„ Adding new fields to Ride table...
âœ… Successfully added new fields to Ride table
ðŸ”„ Creating EmergencyAlert table...
âœ… Successfully created EmergencyAlert table
âœ… Migration completed successfully!

* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

## Step 2: Flutter App Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to Flutter app directory
cd passenger_app

# 2. Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# 3. Connect Android device via USB or start emulator
# Make sure USB debugging is enabled

# 4. Set up ADB reverse (for localhost connection)
adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000

# 5. Run the app
flutter run
```

**Expected output:**
```
Launching lib/main.dart on <device> in debug mode...
âœ“ Built build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk
Installing...
Syncing files to device...
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Connection refused" or "Network error"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure Flask server is running
# Run this in project root:
python run.py

# Make sure adb reverse is active:
adb devices
adb reverse tcp:5000 tcp:5000
```

### Issue: "Email not sent" during signup
**Solution:**
- Check that Flask server shows email configuration
- Verify environment variables are set:
  - MAIL_USERNAME=selamawiride@gmail.com
  - MAIL_PASSWORD=<app password>
- Check terminal output for email sending logs

### Issue: White screen on Flutter app
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd passenger_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Issue: "Database locked" or migration errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop Flask server first
# Then run migration:
python migrate_ride_fields_simple.py

# Restart Flask server
python run.py
```

2. Test saved places (add, delete)
3. Test rating system after ride completion
4. Test SOS functionality
5. Explore ride history filtering
